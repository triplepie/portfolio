	<h3> Pokemon Go is an app that you can get on both Andriod and ios</h3>
	<h3> Most people who haven't been living (yes, you too) have heard of this fun, yet dumb app</h3>
	<h3> The purpose of the app is to simulate the pokemon games in app, and even though it does it poorly it is one of those apps that you could just play for hours.</h3>
	<h3> The goal of this game is to level up, which in turn will get you better pokemon. Once you reach the cap of 30. You have strongest pokemon and try to conquer and clame gyms for your respective team(Instinct FTW).</h3>
