	<h3 style="color: pruple;">As you just saw the proffesor is more or less a nice guy and decides to give you one of his three rare pokemon.</h3>
			<h3>You get to choose between Charmander, Squirtle, ... and what's that other one. Ah who cares about the other on, you weren't going to choose him anyway.</h3>
			<h3> Throughout the games you have to battle the other trainors and one day get good enough to battle the elite four. Who are tend to be the strongest trainors in the game. Once you beat them you get the right to battle the champion. If you win you become the champion of the region, which makes you the strongest trainor in the region.

					<h3>All jokes aside what makes Pokemon really great is that it is an rpg game where you can basacially make your own adventure, and challange yourself to see if you can catch them all.</h3><!--Stupid text-->
